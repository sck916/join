Coder's Lane:

Do you need a coder ASAP? No worries! Hop on coder's lane.

Description:

Our app allows the user to find a coder for any project or task they are working on. First off, our users create a username and password. Then, they are able to scroll/swipe through eligible coders to find their perfect "match". The coders have their email and what languages they are proficient in on their profile. When the user sees the coder they would like to reach out to, they can "match" with the coder and communicate from there! 

Installation:

You must intall axios, express, mongoose, and if-env.

New Tech:

The new technology that we used involves Material-UI and Express Validator
